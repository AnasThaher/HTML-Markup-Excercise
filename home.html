          WHY WOOL? NATURAL Wool is a protein fibre formed in the skin of sheep,
          and is thus one hundred percent natural, not man-made. Since the Stone
          Age, it has been appreciated as one of the most effective forms of
          all-weather protection known to man, and science is yet to produce a
          fibre which matches its unique properties. RENEWABLE As long as there
          is grass to graze on, every year sheep will produce a new fleece;
          making wool a renewable fibre source. Woolgrowers actively work to
          safeguard the environment and improve efficiency, endeavouring to make
          the wool industry sustainable for future generations. BIODEGRADABLE At
          the end of its useful life, wool can be returned to the soil, where it
          decomposes, releasing valuable nutrients into the ground. When a
          natural wool fibre is disposed of in soil, it takes a very short time
          to break down, whereas most synthetics are extremely slow to degrade.
          NATURAL INSULATOR Wool is a hygroscopic fibre. As the humidity of the
          surrounding air rises and falls, the fibre absorbs and releases water
          vapour. Heat is generated and retained during the absorption phase,
          which makes wool a natural insulator. Used in the home, wool
          insulation helps to reduce energy costs and prevents the loss of
          energy to the external environment, thus reducing carbon emissions.
          BREATHABLE Wool fibres are crimped, and when tightly packed together,
          form millions of tiny pockets of air. This unique structure allows it
          to absorb and release moisture—either in the atmosphere or
          perspiration from the wearer—without compromising its thermal
          efficiency. Wool has a large capacity to absorb moisture vapour (up to
          30 per cent of its own weight) next to the skin, making it extremely
          breathable. RESILIENT & ELASTIC Wool fibres resist tearing and are
          able to be bent back on themselves over 20,000 times without breaking.
          Due to its crimped structure, wool is also naturally elastic, and so
          wool garments have the ability to stretch comfortably with the wearer,
          but are then able to return to their natural shape, making them
          resistant to wrinkling and sagging. Wool therefore maintains its
          appearance in the longer term, adding value to the product and its
          lifespan. Wool is also hydrophillic—it is highly absorbent, and
          retains liquids—and so dyes richly while remaining colourfast, without
          the use of chemicals. MULTI-CLIMATIC/ TRANS-SEASONAL Thanks to its
          hygroscopic abilities, wool constantly reacts to changes in body
          temperature, maintaining its wearer’s thermophysical comfort in both
          cold and warm weather. EASY CARE The protective waxy coating on wool
          fibres makes wool products resistant to staining and they also pick up
          less dust as wool is naturally anti-static. Recent innovations mean
          wool items are no longer hand-wash only. Many wool products can now be
          machine-washed and tumble dried. ODOUR RESISTANT Wool is far more
          efficient than other textiles at absorbing sweat and releasing it into
          the air, before bacteria has a chance to develop and produce
          unpleasant body odour. A SAFE SOLUTION Wool is naturally safe. It is
          not known to cause allergies and does not promote the growth of
          bacteria. It can even reduce floating dust in the atmosphere, as the
          fibre’s microscopic scales are able to trap and hold dust in the top
          layers until vacuumed away. Thanks to its high water and nitrogen
          content, wool is naturally flame-retardant, and has a far higher
          ignition threshold than many other fibres, will not melt and stick to
          the skin causing burns, and produces less noxious fumes that cause
          death in fire situations. Finally, wool also has a naturally high
          level of UV protection, which is much higher than most synthetics and
          cotton. Please download here theIWTO Sheep Welfare Guidelines_2013 for
